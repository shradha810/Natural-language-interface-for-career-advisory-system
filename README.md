# Natural-language-interface-for-career-advisory-system
Python code creates a fact which stores the name of the user. Named Entity Recognition is 
implemented for this. Initially, the user is asked to introduce himself/herself. Then, sentence 
tokenisation followed by word tokenisation, POS tagging, creating named entity chunks and to 
extract the chink with PERSON label. Finally, the personâ€™s name is extracted and saved as a fact in a 
text file.
Prolog code runs as before. Now, in the final result of career advise is given with using the name of 
the user.
